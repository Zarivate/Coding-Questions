# Question:

# Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of that array using the Merge Sort
# algorithm. 

# Example:
example_array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]

# Answer:
# example_array = [2, 3, 5, 5, 8, 8, 9]

# Optimal Space & Time Complexity:
# Best, Worst, and Average Case:
# O(nlog(n)) time
# O(n) space 
# n = length of input array


# Explanation:
# To start, what
