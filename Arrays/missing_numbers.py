# Question

# Write a function that takes in an unordered list of unique integers called "nums" in the range of [1, n], where
# n = len(nums + 2), and returns a new list of the 2 missing numbers sorted numerically.


# Example:

nums_example = [1, 4, 3]


# Answer
# [2, 5]
# len(nums_example) = 3, meaning the numbers that could be in the array range from 1-5. The example array is missing
# the 2 and 5 from the given range so return those numbers in an array in ascending order.


# Optimal Space & Time Complexity:
# O(n) time, because will have to iterate through the array
# O(1) space, this is because the new array we create will always have 2 integer values in it. Meaning it will take up
# a total space of O(2) that can be reduced down to O(1) since.


# Explanation:
# The main idea to realize here is how
