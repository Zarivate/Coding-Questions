# Question:

# A pseudo sequel to the number of ways to make change question, in this question you're also given an array of positive
# integers representing coin values and a single non-negative integer "n" representing a target value. Write a function
# that returns the smallest number of coins needed to make change for the target "n"

# Notes:
# Each coin denomination allows for an unlimited number of uses for that coin
# If not possible to reach target "n" from given coins, return -1

# Example:
n = 7
example_coins = [1, 5, 10]

# Answer
# 3
