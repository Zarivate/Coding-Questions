# Question

# Given an array of distinct positive integers representing coins and a single non-negative integer "n",
# that represents a target amount of money, write a function that returns the # of ways to make change for that
# target given the coins provided.

# Note:
# Each coin at your disposal has an unlimited amount of uses

# Example
n = 6
example_coins = [1, 5]

# Answer:
# 2, 1 penny and 1 nickel make 1 + 5 = 6 is one solution, and 6 pennies is the other


# Optimal Space & Time Complexity:
# O(nd) time || O(n) space
# n = target value
# d = number of types of coin


# Explanation:
