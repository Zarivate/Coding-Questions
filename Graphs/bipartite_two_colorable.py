# Note: Hadn't ever heard of the word "bipartite" until this question, still have lots to learn

# Question:
# Given a list of edges representing a graph with at least 1 node, write a function that returns True or False on
# whether that graph is two-colorable/bipartite if every node can have 1 of 2 colors and has no edge connecting
# any node of the same color.

# Notes:
# Graph is connected
# Graph is unweighted, no distance value between nodes
# Graph is undirected, meaning a node can go back and forth between any nodes it's connected to and vice versa.
# There is no 1 way nodes essentially.
# Graph may have self loops, meaning nodes that are connected to themselves forming a loop, if there are any self loops
# in the graphs then it's automatically not two-colorable/returns False
