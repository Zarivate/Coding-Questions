1. (venv) "bug"/package not recognized
    - Not really a bug so much as an idiot moment, but sometimes this project will open in a virtual environment state
      which, while works, is not how this project started and thus results in various missing packages and errors.

    Solution:
    - Ctrl + Shift + p
    - Select the interpretor that comes with default Python installation, not one located in venv -> Scripts
    - Any package that may not be recognized despite showing up in "pip list" should now work


2. cv2.error
    - cv2.error: OpenCV(4.8.0) D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\highgui\src\window.cpp:1272: error: (-2:Unspecified error) 
    The function is not implemented. Rebuild the library with Windows, GTK+ 2.x or Cocoa support. 
    If you are on Ubuntu or Debian, install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config, then re-run cmake or configure script 
    in function 'cvShowImage'

  Solution:
  - pip uninstall opencv-python-headless -y 
   then
  - pip install opencv-python --upgrade


  3. Error loading image paths
    - Had Japanese locale set as default when building this, can either do the same on your machine or just download the Japanese language pack If
      on windows. 
  
  4. Invalid escape sequence
    - Related to system local reason above, if have English locale then slashes for some image paths "\" may need to be reversed to "/".
