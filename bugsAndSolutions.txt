1. (venv) "bug"
    - Not really a bug so much as an idiot moment, but sometimes this project will open in a virtual environment state
      which, while works, is not how this project started and thus results in various missing packages and errors.

    Solution:
    - Ctrl + Shift + p
    - Select the interpretor that comes with default Python installation, not one located in venv -> Scripts

2. cv2.error
    - cv2.error: OpenCV(4.8.0) D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\highgui\src\window.cpp:1272: error: (-2:Unspecified error) 
    The function is not implemented. Rebuild the library with Windows, GTK+ 2.x or Cocoa support. 
    If you are on Ubuntu or Debian, install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config, then re-run cmake or configure script 
    in function 'cvShowImage'

  Solution:
  - pip uninstall opencv-python-headless -y 
   then
  - pip install opencv-python --upgrade
