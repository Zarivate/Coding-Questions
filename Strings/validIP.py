# Question:
# Given a string of length 12 or smaller with only digits. Write a function that returns all possible
# IP addresses that can be created by inserting three periods (.) within the string. All addresses 
# returned should be in string format in no particular order. If no valid IPs, return an empty list.

# Notes:
# Every digit created from insertion of the periods must be in range between 0-255 (inclusive).
# Digits within input string will only ever be positive.
# Also this question is honestly really interesting due to it's optimal space and time complexity.
